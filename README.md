# Week3-Unsupervised-learning-
### Internship Week 3 - Developers Hub
Welcome to my Week 3 internship project at Developers Hub! This week, I focused on implementing **Unsupervised Machine Learning techniques** to uncover hidden patterns and structures in unlabeled datasets.
#### Overview
During this week, I explored key unsupervised learning methods with a focus on **clustering** and **dimensionality reduction**. The main activities included:

* **K-Means Clustering**: Applied to datasets like the Iris dataset to identify natural groupings in the data.
* **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)**: Used to reduce the dimensionality of data while preserving its variance, helping to visualize clusters and simplify models.
* **Outlier Detection**: Identified and handled anomalies to improve clustering performance.
These techniques were used for:
* Pattern discovery in unlabeled data
* Visualizing high-dimensional data in 2D/3D
* Preprocessing data for further analysis or modeling
#### Technologies Used
* Python 3.x
* Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab
* Scikit-learn (for K-Means, PCA)
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib & Seaborn (for visualization)
